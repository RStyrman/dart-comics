# Dart Comics

A simple Dart front-end for organizing comic books.

## Install

A recent [Dart](http://dartlang.org) is required.

 1. Install dependencies with `pub install`
 2. Start the web server with `dart app.dart`
 3. Open the app at http://localhost:8000/ with Dartium

The web code is contained in the `web` top-level directory. Aside from `main.dart` (which is in `web`) most of the client-side Dart code is in the `lib` directory.
